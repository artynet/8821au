News: A new version of this driver is now available. Testing has shown the new driver to be a very solid driver that is much better than the driver here. My recommendation is that you use the new driver.

The plan is to discontinue this driver by the end of December 2021. This URL will then be used to provide basic chipset information and a link to the new driver so this URL is a good permanent bookmark. Please transition to the new driver as you are able to do so. Regards. Nick
